# Relaxing Koala's Restaurant Information System

This is Group 02's implementation of thee Restaurant Information System 
for the Relaxing Koala Restaurant/Caf√©

This website so far has been built using ASP dotnet with MVC. 

*Message for Ngan and Nanh*
MVC is a little bit different from what we planned in the previous assignments.

To put it briefly, 'Views' are pages in our system, 'Models' are the classes (which will be the things we most focus on), Controllers help put everything together.

Please check out tutorial on ASP.NET.
